## Mood Barometer
This application is created to stream twitter and displayed sentiment values.

Using websockets to create a persistent connection to clients, the SERVER can
 broadcast real time udpates.

 To run simply:
>  `python server.py`

Note: Need to add consumer keys and secrets to authorise a connection with Twitter.
